wow such handy tool!

Stock charts on [Tencent Stock](http://stockhtm.finance.qq.com/hqing/zhishu/000001.htm) are constructed of realtime stream data. But the problem is, when we developed after the market closed, all the response data is static and contains the whole daily dataset.

We want to record the old data like making a film and replay it like how the **bioscope** works.

We will develop a data record and playback machine based on Golang.

Yep, that "we" means [AlphaLi](https://github.com/alphali) and I.
